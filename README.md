# LanChat
Small project that I am working on, This uses Batch. Only works on windows.
## How does it work?
Basically, what I am trying to do is have a  ***VERY*** confusing way of creating a lan chat program.
I am trying to create commands, users, admins, multiple rooms that you can chat in, 
private rooms, and ideas I haven't thought of yet.
## What do I need?
* (2+) Computers running Windows 7+
* A brain.
* Someone to be at the other end to communicate with.
